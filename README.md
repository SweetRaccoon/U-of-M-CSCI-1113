# U-of-M-CSCI-1113
Textbook practice problem Solutions generated by myself

You could search online for the following textbook info
Walter A. Savitch, Problem Solving with C++ Pearson, (10th edition).

All the codes here are from Chapter 2 to Chapter 4 textbook practice problems

Mainly for the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities CSCI 1113 Intro to Programming in C/C++
Maybe helpful for all the begiining learners in C++

I haven't push all of the solutions for all the chapters in that textbook, you could check back further for any updates 

If you notice any bugs with my codes, please comment or you could fork my repo and update by yourself, thanks
